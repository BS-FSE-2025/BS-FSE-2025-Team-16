## Project Name: PlantPricer ðŸŒ±
PlantPricer is a web application that helps users design and plan their dream home garden. It allows users to visualize their garden layout, estimate costs, and explore a comprehensive database of plants and garden elements. Additionally, users can choose
to copy a design from one of the site's own designers and build off their
designs as a baseline. The site also has a list of suppliers, that can update the
site's item list. Users can look at the supplier/designer pages to get in contact
with them and use their services if they need to.
## Features
* Visual design tools for arranging plants in your garden.
* Calculate the total cost of your garden plan.
* A comprehensive plant and garden element database with pricing and additional info.
* Easy-to-use interface for creating and saving your garden plans.
* Lists of desingers and suppliers to help you bring your garden to life.

```
Then, open 2 new terminals.
On one terminal, navigate to the backend_ folder by typing:
```bash
cd backend_
```
and then install the backend packages using the command:
```bash
